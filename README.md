ounce:application<br>
  This mojo generates an Ounce application file. It will automatically include
  all child modules as projects. This list make be modified using the includes
  and excludes patterns. Projects that are external to this build may be
  included directly using the externalProjects list. External Applications may
  also be included. All of their modules will be inherted as part of this
  application file. Those projects may also be filtered upon import.

  Available parameters:

    appDir (Default: ${basedir})
      Specifies the directory where to create the paf file
      Expression: ${ounce.appDir}

    appName (Default: ${project.artifactId})
      Specifies the directory where to create the paf file
      Expression: ${ounce.appName}

    coreHint (Default: ouncexml)
      This hint provides a way to switch the core implementation. Consult Ounce
      support for details, most users should leave this set to the default. Use
      -Dounce.core=console to have have the output displayed instead of written
      to the file for debugging purposes.
      Expression: ${ounce.core}

    excludes
      An array of directories containing the pom file of any projects to
      exclude. Excludes can contain standard Ant-style wildcards.
      Excludes only apply to inherited modules, not external projects. The
      current project is not filtered.

    externalApplications
      Allows you to include projects from multiple applications. The external
      application properties are not inherited, and the external application
      must already exist.
      externalApplications is a list of directories containing top-level pom
      files.
      The format for externalApplications is:
      pathname,[includes|includes],[excludes|excludes]
      Where:
      
      - pathname, includes, and excludes are comma delimited; if you have
        excludes, but no includes, use two commas.
      - Multiple includes or excludes are separated by pipes (\x7c).
      - Excludes can contain standard Ant style wildcards.

    externalProjects
      List of external projects to include. These projects are included after
      any other projects have been included or excluded.
      The format is: name,path
      Where:
      
      - name is the artifact ID of the project to include.
      - path is the pathname to the project.

    includes
      An array of directories containing the pom file of any projects to
      include. If an include pattern is specified, projects not specifed by
      include patterns are excluded.
      Include only applies to inherited modules, not external projects. The
      current project is not filtered.
      The include pattern may contain the following wildcard characters:
      *: Zero or more characters
      **: Any folders
      ?: One and only one character

      the poms have no source to be analyzed Only set this if you have source in
      your 'pom' packaging projects that needs to be scanned.
